# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code (or any assistant) working in this repository.

## Project overview

The Azure side of a job-market data pipeline. A separate repository
([`job-scrapper`](https://github.com/pa741/job-scrapper)) runs a JobSpy scraper on a NAS
and uploads timestamped CSVs to Blob Storage. This repository ingests them: postings into
Azure SQL, metrics into Cosmos DB, triggered by Event Grid on blob creation.

`../model.md` holds the target architecture for the whole system. Ingestion and Data are
built; Realtime, API and Frontend are not.

## Public repo hygiene

**This repository is public.** It is a portfolio piece, so the bar is absolute rather than
best-effort.

- **Never commit real identifiers.** Subscription ids, tenant ids, object ids and resource
  names belong in environment variables. `infra/main.bicepparam` reads them via
  `readEnvironmentVariable()`; real values go in `infra/main.local.bicepparam`, which is
  gitignored.
- **Never commit scraped data.** Real exports contain populated `emails` and descriptions
  carrying recruiter names and contact details. `*.csv` is gitignored except under
  `tests/**/Fixtures/`, and the fixture there is entirely synthetic.
- **Never introduce a secret.** The architecture has none by design (see below). If a
  change seems to need a password, key or connection secret, that is a signal the design
  is being worked around — find the identity-based path instead.
- `local.settings.json`, `*.PublishSettings` and `*.pubxml` are gitignored because they
  genuinely carry credentials.
- Before pushing, check `git ls-files` for stray CSVs and `git grep` for identifiers.

## Authentication model

There is no password, key or connection secret anywhere, and it should stay that way:

- Azure SQL: `azureADOnlyAuthentication: true`. No SQL login exists. Connection strings use
  `Authentication=Active Directory Default`.
- Cosmos DB: `disableLocalAuth: true`. Access is a data-plane role assignment
  (`sqlRoleAssignments`), not a key.
- Storage: identity-based connections (`__serviceUri` + `__credential=managedidentity`).
  The Functions host account sets `allowSharedKeyAccess: false`.
- GitHub Actions: OIDC federated credential pinned to `main`. No client secret.

The function runs under a **user-assigned** managed identity, deliberately: the planned
Container Apps API will need the same grants, and a shared identity means granting once.

## Key files

- `src/JobPlatform.Core/Parsing/JobCsvParser.cs` — the JobSpy CSV contract. Written against
  the real 34-column export; changes here need a fixture case.
- `src/JobPlatform.Core/Metrics/MetricsCalculator.cs` — every metric. Pure and Azure-free,
  which is why the metric surface is fully unit-testable.
- `src/JobPlatform.Data/Sql/JobPostingRepository.cs` — the upsert, and the daily rollup
  aggregates.
- `src/JobPlatform.Ingestion/IngestionPipeline.cs` — the digest, shared by the blob trigger
  and the admin reprocess endpoint so both run the same path.
- `infra/main.bicep` — the whole stack.

## Conventions and constraints

- **Flex Consumption supports only the event-based blob trigger.** The polling trigger will
  not fire there. Hence `Source = BlobTriggerSource.EventGrid` and the Event Grid system
  topic in `infra/modules/eventgrid.bicep`.
- **Cosmos serialization is pinned to camelCase System.Text.Json** in `CosmosClientFactory`.
  The SDK default emits PascalCase, which breaks both the required `id` field and the
  `/searchTerm` partition key path. `CosmosClient` must stay a singleton — it owns the
  connection pool.
- **The SQL database auto-pauses.** Waking it takes 30-60s, so EF is configured with
  `EnableRetryOnFailure` and a 60s connect timeout. Keep connections short-lived: an open
  connection prevents auto-pause and burns the free vCore-second grant. Avoid adding
  per-row round trips for the same reason.
- **The Cosmos SDK needs `Newtonsoft.Json` at runtime**, even though item serialization is
  pinned to System.Text.Json. It is referenced explicitly in `JobPlatform.Data`. Do not
  "fix" the build check with `AzureCosmosDisableNewtonsoftJsonCheck` - that only hides it
  until the published app fails with `Could not load file or assembly 'Newtonsoft.Json'`.
- **A user-assigned identity needs its client id in the SQL connection string**
  (`User Id=<clientId>`), otherwise `Authentication=Active Directory Default` fails with
  "Unable to load the proper Managed Identity". It is appended in
  `infra/modules/functionapp.bicep`, not in the sql module's output, so that output stays
  usable by a developer signing in as themselves.
- **HTTP functions use ASP.NET Core integration types** (`HttpRequest`/`IActionResult`),
  because the host is built with `ConfigureFunctionsWebApplication`. Mixing in
  `HttpRequestData` silently leaves the route unmapped. Also avoid an `admin/` route
  prefix - it is reserved by the host and puts the function in an error state.
- **The blob trigger's poison queue lives on the trigger's connection** (the landing
  account), not on host storage, so the identity needs Queue Data Contributor on both.
- **Ingestion must stay idempotent.** `ScrapeRuns.BlobPath` is unique and metric document
  ids derive from the blob path. Event Grid redelivers; a replayed blob must converge.
- **The SQL server lives in a different region from the rest of the stack** (`sqlLocation`
  in `infra/main.bicep`). This is not an oversight: the free offer is not provisionable in
  Spain Central or West Europe on this subscription, and several other regions refuse new
  SQL servers entirely. France Central works. Probe with a throwaway server before changing
  it, and remember a server's region is immutable — changing it means deleting and
  recreating.
- **Free-tier ceilings are load-bearing**, not incidental: Cosmos autoscale max 1000 RU/s,
  SQL `useFreeLimit` with `freeLimitExhaustionBehavior: AutoPause`. Raising either starts
  billing.
- Metrics changes belong in `MetricsCalculator` with a matching assertion in
  `MetricsCalculatorTests`, against the synthetic fixture's known-by-construction counts.

## Common tasks

```bash
dotnet build
dotnet test                       # no Azure credentials needed

# Schema change
dotnet ef migrations add <Name> --project src/JobPlatform.Data --output-dir Sql/Migrations
dotnet run --project tools/JobPlatform.DbAdmin -- migrate "<connection-string>"

# Full provision (idempotent)
./scripts/provision.ps1 -ResourceGroup <rg> -LandingStorageAccount <account>
```

Regenerating the test fixture is deliberate manual work — it is hand-built so its counts
are known by construction, which is what makes the metric assertions exact.
